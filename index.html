<h1>Front Page</h1>

<p align="justify">
The Matsunoki Treebank is a corpus of Tsugaru-ben folktales
with hand worked tree analysis.
Tsugaru-ben is a dialect spoken in the Tsugaru region of Japan.
The Tsugaru region is on the west side of Aomori prefecture,
the northernmost prefecture on Japan's mainland of Honshu.
Highlights of the corpus include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>(Hepburn) romanisation
<li>English glosses
<li>full lemmatisation for Tsugaru-ben words linked to dictionary word sense definitions
<li>labelled constituent structure
<li>assignments of grammatical function
<li>zero elements
<li>information to resolve anaphoric dependencies
</ul>

<p align="justify">
Further results &mdash; notably, dependency graphs &mdash; derived from the analysis
can be seen with the search interface.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The name Matsunoki,
meaning &lsquo;pine tree&rsquo; in English,
derives from the frequent appearance of pine trees in
the folktale stories that make up the data of the corpus. 
</p>

<h2>About the corpus data</h2>

<p align="justify">
The corpus data comes from audio samples spoken by native speakers of Tsugaru-ben.
The samples consist of readings of Mukashi-Banashi (Japanese Folktales) related to the Tsugaru region,
which are presented in the dialect.
There are 26 readings in total,
representing nearly four hours of spoken data.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The speakers are all members of the &ldquo;Wa No Hanashiko&rdquo; group.
Tsuri Sato (佐藤ツリ) who is the representative of this group,
started the activity in 2003 with the aim of handing down folktales of the Tsugaru region.
The group is based in the Hirosaki area and has approximately 300 members.
The group tells stories in Tsugaruben during visits to retirement houses,
community centers, and events held by the social welfare council.
They also share folktales in this region on the local TV station
and work with Hakuryu Shibutani (澁谷白龍)
who is a researcher of dialect and Senryu which is a form of short poetry (Megumi 2021).
</p>

<p align="justify">
Using folktale data has strengths and weaknesses. One advantage is the presence of rich
vocabulary. Folktales contain unique and old vocabulary,
so folktales are a good resource to initiate a Tsugaruben corpus and word database.
However, due to the nature of folktales, some of the words or phrases
which appear in the Tsugaruben folktales are exaggerated
Tsugaruben or they are Tsugaruben that is not in daily use.
For this reason, some examples in The Matsunoki Treebank can be said to be unnatural,
and not fully representative of Tsugaruben as it is spoken today.
</p>

<h2>About the annotation</h2>

<p align="justify">
Hepburn is used as the system of romanization
because of its compatibility with the suite of programs and grammar files used
during the creation of the morphological analysis.
The method of word segmentation and morphological analysis uses
the <a href="http://www2.aasa.ac.jp/people/smiyata/CHILDESmanual/datafiles/wakachi2002v8/00index.html">WAKACHI2002</a> (Miyata 2018)
inventory of word class and morpheme codes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The tree annotation is based on <a href="https://jptrees.github.io/">The Kusunoki Treebank</a> (Kainoki 2022),
a parsed corpus of contemporary Japanese.
Syntactic structure is represented with labelled parentheses in the style of the Penn Treebank (Bies et al. 1995).
More particularly, the Penn Historical Corpora scheme (Santorini 2010) has informed the &lsquo;look&rsquo; of the annotation.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>adoption of the <a href="http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/CS-manual/YourCorpus.html">CorpusSearch format</a> (Randall 2009) as the underlying encoding,</li>
<li>not having any explicit verb phrase structure (although verb phrase structure is implicitly present when there are interpretive consequences),</li>
<li>the use of <tt>IP</tt>, <tt>ADVP</tt>, <tt>NP</tt>, and <tt>PP</tt> tag labels,</li>
<li>the presentation of phrase conjunction structure with <tt>CONJP</tt> layers, and</li>
<li>the marking of function for all clausal nodes and all clause level constituents.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
Annotation practice strives for observational adequacy.
The aim is to present a consistent linguistic analysis for each attestation of an identifiable linguistic relation or process.
The annotation also offers syntactic analysis for the subsequent generation of meaning representations using the methods of <a href="http://www.compling.jp/ajb129/ts.html">Treebank Semantics</a> (Butler 2015).
</p>

<h2>Search Interface</h2>

<p align="justify">
The Matsunoki Treebank is associated with a powerful user <b><a href="https://oncoj.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/kusunoki.sh">interface</a></b>
that enables search using virtually any aspect of the annotation.
Results of specific searches can be downloaded in the form of annotated data.
The source data to which the search interface links is being updated constantly to reflect improvements in analysis.
</p>

<h2>About the dictionary</h2>

<p align="justify">
The search interface includes an integrated dictionary function
that links English glosses of the annotation to word sense definitions disambiguated with numbers.
For example, <tt>run1</tt> links up to the definition for a human running,
while <tt>run2</tt> links up to the definition for driving a vehicle.
Enabling &ldquo;word&rdquo; mode by clicking &ldquo;word&rdquo; at the top of the interface
shows correspondences between Tsugaru-ben words and their word sense definitions for all of the texts. 
</p>

<!--

<h2>Using the corpus for advanced research</h2>

<p align="justify">
The available on-line interface is a powerful and flexible tool sufficient for many research purposes, but note that the data on which it operates is updated in real time.
For extended research projects it is often advisable to download a release version for use off-line.
This not only provides the advanced researcher a stable set of data,
but also allows for manipulation of the data to reflect analyses that are not included in the present online corpus
but are necessary for a given research project.
</p>

<h2>Data format</h2>

<p align="justify">
The working data format of The Matsunoki Treebank is
the <tt>.cha</tt> format required by the <a href="https://dali.talkbank.org/clan/">CLAN programs</a> of the CHILDES project.
The content of the <tt>.cha</tt> files is then merged with tree information from The Kainoki Treebank
to create trees in the bracketed format required by <a href="http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/CS-manual/YourCorpus.html">CorpusSearch</a>.
</p>

<h2>Mistakes</h2>

<p align="justify">
As with any annotated text corpus, there are mistakes in The Matsunoki Treebank.
The corpus is ongoing work and is under continuous improvement and correction.
Mistakes will be corrected as they become apparent and as time allows.
We will be grateful to be made aware of mistakes and will endeavour to eliminate them with the help of users (<a href="contact.html">contact</a>).
